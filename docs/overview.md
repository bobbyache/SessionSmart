
## Reason
Build interactive practice and play routines where practiced is managed in a structured way.
- Practice against backing tracks
- Managed how tracks are played to ensure the most optimium pratice sessions.


The user would like to convert GP files to sound files of different tempos and then create routines where these files are presented and can be played one after another. The system will display the example track (and information such as guitar tone, tempo,etc.) to the user. The system will beging playing back the example track to the user. 

The system will calculate how many times the user will practice the track in the time allotted to the user and present this to the user. The system will use the tempo entered to count in the next loop. Could be a screen prompt 4...3...2...1... or an audible tick.

Different orders can be presented.

MVP would be to load and execute a simple sequenced routine.

Should be useful for:
- Practice routines
- Playable Sessions (for friends or gigs).
